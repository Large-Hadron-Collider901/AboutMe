<!-- Short Bio -->
<div>
<p> Hello there! It looks like you have found my webpage so I'm going to go ahead and introduce myself. Let me start with the basics,
my name is Skye McCullough and I am 24 years old! I am originally from a little place called LaCrosse Wisconsin, but I've 
found a home for myself in Memphis Tennessee! I much prefer winters in Tennessee to winters in Wisconsin and it humors me when 
I am still wearing shorts and everybody else is freezing. 
  On a more serious note, I come from a non-traditional background, however, I am excited to announce that I am breaking into
the tech industry! I am currently enrolled at the Code Collective Academy where I am training to become a software developer.
Additionally, I am an entrepreneur and small business owner. My etsy shop is still under construction but I hope to have it up 
and running soon! I have lots of handcrafted home decor that I absolutely can not wait to share with the world.
  Outside of my shop and my education, I am also a dog mom :-) My dog is a pitbull named Abram, and I love spending time with him
and playing frisbee! I have a wide variety of interests, so in my free time, I am all over the place. I love to explore nature,
as I  have a knack for identifying different plants and herbs & discovering their different applications. Some of my other hobbies
include: singing, playing guitar, writing, drawing, jewelry making, looking at stuff under a microscrope... the list goes on and 
on and on but I digress. </p>
