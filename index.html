  <!-- Short Bio -->
  <div>
    <p> Hello there, it looks like you have found my webpage so I'm going to go ahead and introduce myself. Let me start
      with the basics,
      my name is Skye McCullough! I am originally from a little place called LaCrosse Wisconsin, but I've
      found a home for myself in Memphis Tennessee! I much prefer winters in Tennessee to winters in Wisconsin and it
      humors me when
      I am still wearing shorts and everybody else is freezing.
      On a more serious note, let me try to give you a better idea of who I am and
      what i'm about! I come from a non-traditional background,
      however, I am excited to announce that I am breaking into
      the tech industry! I am currently enrolled at the Code Collective Academy where I am training to become a software
      developer.
      Additionally, I am an entrepreneur and small business owner. My etsy shop is still under construction but I hope
      to have it up
      and running soon! I have lots of handcrafted home decor that I absolutely can not wait to share with the world.
      Outside of my shop and my education, I am also a dog mom :-) I have a pitbull named Abram, he is 7 years old but
      he's still my baby!
      I love spending time with him at the park and playing frisbee! I have a wide variety of interests, so in my free
      time, I am all over
      the place. I love to explore nature, as I have a knack for identifying different plants and herbs & discovering
      their different
      applications. For example, some plants smell good when they are burned, so I can dry them out and make incense
      with them, others
      I can cast in resin to make pendants for jewelry, also some plants and herbs are great for making tea. Some of my
      other hobbies
      include: singing, playing guitar, writing, drawing, looking at stuff under a microscope, ah you get the point, my
      interests are
      endless. I am a "Jill of all trades, master of none."

    <h1>Grounding Exercises</h1>
    <p>A couple of years ago, I really started to embrace self-care culture and began practicing grounding exercises.
      A grounding exercise is essentially any activity that helps you to focus on the five senses: sight, smell, sound,
      touch, and taste.
      them. These activities are particularly helpful for trauma survivors, as well as people who struggle with
      dissociation, panic attacks
      or anxiety. However, anyone can benefit from them. The idea behind this coping strategy is to pull yourself out of
      a flashback, anxiety
      attack, or even just an uncomfortable feeling and re connecting with your surroundings, by allowing your senses to
      bring you back to the
      present moment, where you have total control on your mind and body.Here are my top ten favorite grounding
      exercises!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hula-Hooping</li>
      <li>Lighting resin incense</li>
      <li>Weeding & watering my garden</li>
